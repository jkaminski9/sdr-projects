- First, sincere thanks for your trust and purchase. The best thing I have encountered as an author (even with this kind of technical content) is the human connection with so many people from every corner of the planet. 

- Needless to say, thanks in advance for keeping the Wireless Communications book offline and for your private use. 

- As a gift, I have also included my little eBook 'A Real-Imaginative Guide to Complex Numbers'. This topic is so close to my heart, yet I have never seen anyone explain the idea of complex numbers in this way, either by mathematicians or the engineers. I can hope that this view of complex numbers is as delightful to you as it was to me.

- Finally, the Wireless Communications PDF file contains clickable links. You can click on any chapter, section, subsection, figure or equation number for a fluent reading experience. In case you encounter problems with certain fonts in the file (because they are not installed on your computer), please let me know at info@wirelesspi.com and I will send you another eBook copy with embedded fonts right away. Then you should be able to read everything whether all the fonts used in the book are installed on your own computer or not. Please keep in mind that the links do not remain clickable after embedding the fonts though.
